# Week 0: Validation (Most Important Week!)

**Goal**: Get 3 venues to say "yes, I'd try this" BEFORE writing any code.

## The 20-Call Rule

Make 20 calls to venues using this exact script:

> "Hi, I'm [Your Name]. I'm building a simple way to sell your last-minute empty seats. It's completely free to try. Would you be interested?"

## Target Venues

### 🎭 Small Comedy Clubs
- Always have empty seats
- Desperate for weeknight revenue
- Easy to onboard

### 🎪 Afternoon Theater
- Matinee shows often undersold
- Willing to discount
- Established customer service

### 🎵 Weeknight Music Venues
- Tuesday/Wednesday slow nights
- Young, tech-friendly owners
- Open to experiments

## Success Criteria

✅ **Success**: 3 venues say "yes" in 20 calls  
❌ **Failure**: Less than 3 yeses = **PIVOT THE IDEA**

## Why This Matters

If you can't get 3 venues to say yes to a **free money-making tool**, the problem isn't technical.

This week saves you from building something nobody wants.

## What to Ask

1. "Do you ever have empty seats?"
2. "Would you be willing to sell them at a discount?"
3. "Can we try this with one show next week?"

## Red Flags

- "We'll think about it" = No
- "Our ticketing system is complex" = No  
- "We need to ask corporate" = No

## Green Flags

- "Yes, we always have empty seats"
- "How much commission do you take?"
- "Can you help us set it up?"

## After 3 Yeses

**Only then** start coding. You now have guaranteed customers for your MVP.

## If You Get Less Than 3 Yeses

Don't build this. Try a different approach:
- Corporate events that need last-minute catering
- Restaurants with empty tables
- Fitness classes with open spots

**Building the wrong thing perfectly is worse than not building anything.**
