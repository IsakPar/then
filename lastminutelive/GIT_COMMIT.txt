ðŸŽ« MAJOR: Implement Professional Seat Reservation System

Complete transformation from basic ticketing to sophisticated venue-specific 
seat reservation system with dynamic pricing and visual seat selection.

âœ¨ Key Features:
- 10-minute seat reservations with automatic expiry  
- Dynamic venue sections (A-K) with custom pricing multipliers
- Visual seat picker with real-time availability
- Two-phase booking: reserve â†’ pay â†’ confirm
- Stripe webhook integration for payment confirmation
- Race condition prevention & atomic seat locking
- Mobile-first responsive design
- React key fixes & UI improvements

ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation:
- Database functions: reserve_seats(), confirm_reservation()
- New tables: venue_sections, show_section_pricing  
- Enhanced API routes with TypeScript validation
- Row Level Security & proper access controls
- Fresh start migration script for clean setup

ðŸš¨ CRITICAL BUG FIXED: Previous system processed payments but never 
created seat bookings, allowing double-booking. Now impossible.

ðŸ“‹ Migration Required: Run fresh-start-migration.sql
ðŸš€ Production Ready: Professional booking flow implemented

Files changed:
- fresh-start-migration.sql (NEW): Complete database setup
- src/app/api/seat-checkout/route.ts: Reservation-first API
- src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts: Payment confirmation  
- src/app/show/[id]/seats/page.tsx: Visual seat selection UI
- Database schema: venue_sections, show_section_pricing tables
- Multiple UI fixes and React key improvements

Breaking Changes: Database migration required
Migration Script: fresh-start-migration.sql (safe to run multiple times)
