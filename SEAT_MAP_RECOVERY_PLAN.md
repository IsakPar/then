# Seat Map Recovery Plan

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ What's Working
- **Data Fetching**: Successfully pulling 1644 seats, show data, and seatmap data
- **Database**: All queries working correctly
- **API Endpoints**: `/api/shows/[id]/seats` and `/api/shows/[id]/seatmap` responding
- **Core Engine**: `seatmap-engine/` directory has working renderer and examples

### ❌ Critical Issues
1. **Missing Component**: `EnterpriseSeatMap.tsx` is missing, causing build failures
2. **Rendering Failure**: Data transformation works but rendering fails
3. **Over-Engineering**: Multiple abstraction layers causing confusion
4. **Import Issues**: Components trying to import non-existent files

## Root Cause Analysis

The main problem is **architectural fragmentation**:
- We have a working `seatmap-engine/` with examples
- We have a missing `EnterpriseSeatMap.tsx` component
- Data flows correctly but fails at the rendering stage
- Too many abstraction layers between data and display

## Recovery Strategy

### Phase 1: Create Working Component (Day 1)
**Goal**: Get basic seat map displaying

#### Step 1.1: Create EnterpriseSeatMap.tsx
- Create a simple, working version that uses the existing `seatmap-engine/`
- Focus on rendering, not editing features
- Use the working `demo.html` as reference

#### Step 1.2: Fix Imports
- Update all components importing `EnterpriseSeatMap` 
- Ensure the import path is correct in `/show/[id]/seats/page.tsx`

#### Step 1.3: Data Transformation
- Create a simple data transformer from your DB format to seatmap-engine format
- Use the existing `sample-map.json` as the target format
- Skip complex features, focus on basic seat display

### Phase 2: Basic Functionality (Day 2)
**Goal**: Interactive seat selection working

#### Step 2.1: Seat Selection
- Implement basic click-to-select functionality
- Update seat status (available, selected, sold)
- Handle seat status updates

#### Step 2.2: Section Display
- Show different sections with correct colors
- Display pricing information
- Basic hover effects

#### Step 2.3: Real-time Updates
- Implement seat locking/unlocking
- Handle concurrent user sessions
- Basic WebSocket integration

### Phase 3: Polish & Production (Day 3)
**Goal**: Production-ready seat map

#### Step 3.1: Error Handling
- Robust error handling for API failures
- Loading states and retry mechanisms
- Graceful degradation

#### Step 3.2: Performance
- Optimize rendering for large venues (1000+ seats)
- Implement seat virtualization if needed
- Reduce unnecessary re-renders

#### Step 3.3: Mobile Responsiveness
- Touch-friendly seat selection
- Responsive layout for mobile devices
- Zoom and pan functionality

## Implementation Plan

### Immediate Actions (Next 2 hours)

1. **Create EnterpriseSeatMap.tsx**
   ```typescript
   // Basic structure using existing seatmap-engine
   import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
   
   export default function EnterpriseSeatMap({ showData, seatData, seatmapData }) {
     const containerRef = useRef(null);
     
     useEffect(() => {
       if (containerRef.current && showData && seatData && seatmapData) {
         // Use existing seatmap-engine/index.js
         // Transform data to match sample-map.json format
         // Initialize renderer
       }
     }, [showData, seatData, seatmapData]);
     
     return <div ref={containerRef} className="seatmap-container" />;
   }
   ```

2. **Fix Page Import**
   - Update `src/app/show/[id]/seats/page.tsx` to import the new component
   - Ensure proper error handling

3. **Data Transformer**
   - Create simple function to convert DB data to seatmap-engine format
   - Focus on essential fields: id, position, status, section

### Success Metrics

#### Phase 1 Success
- [ ] No build errors
- [ ] Seat map renders without crashing
- [ ] Basic seat positions display correctly
- [ ] Sections show with correct colors

#### Phase 2 Success
- [ ] Seats can be selected/deselected
- [ ] Status changes persist
- [ ] Real-time updates work
- [ ] Mobile responsive

#### Phase 3 Success
- [ ] Handles 1000+ seats smoothly
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Production-ready performance
- [ ] Full test coverage

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk: Data Format Mismatch
**Mitigation**: Create comprehensive data transformer with validation

### Medium Risk: Performance Issues
**Mitigation**: Implement seat virtualization and optimize rendering

### Low Risk: Mobile Issues
**Mitigation**: Progressive enhancement approach

## Resource Requirements

### Development Time
- **Phase 1**: 4-6 hours
- **Phase 2**: 8-10 hours  
- **Phase 3**: 6-8 hours
- **Total**: 18-24 hours (3 days)

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for data transformation
- Integration tests for seat selection
- Performance tests for large venues
- Mobile device testing

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional**: Seat map displays and allows selection
2. **Performant**: Handles Hamilton's 1644 seats smoothly
3. **Reliable**: Robust error handling and recovery
4. **Maintainable**: Clean, documented code
5. **Scalable**: Easy to add new venues/layouts

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 1.1**: Create basic EnterpriseSeatMap.tsx
2. **Test with Hamilton data**: Use existing 1644 seats as test case
3. **Iterate quickly**: Focus on working solution over perfect architecture
4. **Document decisions**: Keep track of what works and what doesn't

## Notes

- **Avoid over-engineering**: The current seatmap-engine works, build on it
- **Focus on data flow**: Ensure clean transformation from DB to display
- **Test early and often**: Don't wait for perfect implementation
- **Keep it simple**: Complex features can come later

*This plan prioritizes getting a working seat map over perfect architecture. We can refactor and improve once we have a solid foundation.*
