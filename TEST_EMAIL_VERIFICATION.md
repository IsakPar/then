# Email Verification Test Guide

## üß™ Testing Email Verification

### Test 1: Email Verification with Development Mode

When `MAILJET_API_KEY` is not configured (development mode), emails are logged to console:

```bash
# 1. Start your server
pnpm run dev

# 2. Create a test user
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "SecurePassword123!",
    "name": "Test User"
  }'

# 3. Check your server logs for the email verification link
# Look for lines like:
# üìß Development mode: Email would be sent to: test@example.com
# üìß Subject: Verify Your LastMinuteLive Email
# üìß Content (first 200 chars): Hi Test User, Welcome to LastMinuteLive!...
```

### Test 2: Email Verification with Mailjet

When `MAILJET_API_KEY` is configured, actual emails are sent:

```bash
# 1. Configure Mailjet in your .env.local
MAILJET_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
MAILJET_SECRET_KEY=your_actual_secret_key

# 2. Restart your server
pnpm run dev

# 3. Create a test user with your real email
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "your-real-email@example.com",
    "password": "SecurePassword123!",
    "name": "Test User"
  }'

# 4. Check your email inbox for the verification email
# 5. Click the verification link to confirm it works
```

### Test 3: Booking Confirmation Email

```bash
# 1. Complete a booking through the seat selection process
# 2. Go through Stripe checkout (use test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242)
# 3. Check your email for the booking confirmation with:
#    - Show details
#    - Seat information
#    - Validation code
```

- `üìß Development mode: Email would be sent to: user@example.com`
- `‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to send booking confirmation email`

## üö® Common Issues

### Issue 1: Emails Not Sending
